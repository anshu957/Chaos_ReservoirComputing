### A very basic implementation of Reservoir that can learn chaotic systems

## To run you need to have following:
1. Numpy 
2. [Jitcode](https://github.com/neurophysik/jitcode) 

## Example(Rossler Attractor): 

1. --> python3 rossler.py 
2. --> Command line arguments can be given. For complete list of arguments, see
**rossler.py**
3. --> Warning: Parameters, leaky_rate and inputScaling_radius is quite sensitive for reasons currently unknown to me. Avoid changing them!
