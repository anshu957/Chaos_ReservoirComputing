## A very basic implementation of Reservoir that can learn chaotic systems

### To run you need to have the following installed in your working python environment:
1. Numpy 
2. [Jitcode](https://github.com/neurophysik/jitcode) 

### Example(Rossler Attractor): 

1. __To run__:  python3 rossler.py 
2. --> Command line arguments can be given. For complete list of arguments, see
**rossler.py**
3. --> Warning: Parameters, **leaky_rate** and **inputScaling_radius** are quite sensitive for reasons currently unknown to me. Avoid changing them!
